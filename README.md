# WeatherMap

Inspired by the [WeatherMap plugin for Cacti](https://www.network-weathermap.com/), WeatherMap Panel Plugin for Grafana.

This plugin is created to map a computer network. This makes it possible to be informed in real time in case a computer system is malfunctioning or other.

It takes data from your network devices and uses it to provide a single-page overview of the current state of network

We can compare this to the presentation of the weather.
Indeed, the background with the computer network can represent a country. And we add on this background regions, points and links which can refer to the weather in a given city.
In addition, it is possible to add values from the network device to each region, point or link, just as you can add the temperature for a city.

Many settings are available to customize the rendering.
